# ‚ö° Agile
**Agile** is best described as a **project management philosophy or mindset**. 
It's not a specific set of rules or procedures, but rather a collection of guiding principles and values. 
The core ideas of Agile, as laid out in the Agile Manifesto, are:

### üóùÔ∏è Key Principles of Agile
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan
Think of Agile as the "what" and "why" ‚Äì a flexible, iterative approach to managing projects. 
This means Agile teams value people, working results, and flexibility more than rigid rules or paperwork.

### üë• Who is Agile For?
- Creative Teams: Designers and developers building websites or apps, like your startup, who need to iterate quickly and incorporate client feedback.
- Startups and Small Businesses: Companies with changing priorities or limited resources benefit from Agile's flexibility and fast delivery.
- Clients and Stakeholders: CEOs, marketers, or clients who want to see progress and have input throughout the project, ensuring the final product aligns with their vision.
- Any Project with Uncertainty: Teams working on innovative or complex projects where requirements may evolve, such as new app features or website redesigns.
- Example: From Waterfall to Agile

### üï∞Ô∏è How did Agile came to be: 
People used to work with the Waterfall method to creating Agile
- Waterfall (Old Way): Imagine building a website by planning everything upfront‚Äîdesign, features, and code‚Äîover months. If the CEO wants a new feature (like a chatbot) after coding starts, it's hard to add without delays or extra costs. This rigid, step-by-step approach often leads to a final product that doesn't match current needs.
- Agile (New Way): Instead, we build the website in short sprints. In two weeks, we create a basic homepage, show it to the CEO, and get feedback. If they want a chatbot, we add it in the next sprint. This keeps the project flexible, delivers results faster, and ensures the website matches the CEO's vision.

## üîÑ How Does the Agile Process Work?
1. **Break the project into small pieces**: Instead of trying to finish everything at once, the team divides the work into smaller tasks or features.
2. **Work in short cycles (called sprints)**: Each cycle lasts a set amount of time (usually 1-4 weeks). The team picks a few tasks to complete during this time.
3. **Daily check-ins**: Every day, the team has a short meeting (called a stand-up) to discuss progress, plans, and any problems.
4. **Review and improve**: At the end of each sprint, the team reviews what they finished, gets feedback, and talks about how to work better next time.
5. **Repeat**: The team starts a new sprint, using what they learned to improve.

## üèÅ What are Sprints?
A **sprint** is a short, fixed period (usually 1-2 weeks) where the team focuses on completing a set of tasks. At the end of the sprint, the team should have something usable or testable to show.

### üìù Example of a Sprint
- **Sprint length**: 2 weeks
- **Goal**: Add a login page to the website
- **Tasks**:
  - Design the login page
  - Build the login form
  - Connect the form to the backend
  - Test the login process

At the end of the sprint, the team reviews the login page together, checks if it works, and asks for feedback. Then they plan the next sprint (for example, adding a registration page).

## üí° Why Use Agile?
- You get feedback early and often, so you can fix problems quickly.
- The team can adapt to changes, like new ideas or requirements.
- Work is delivered in small, manageable pieces, making it easier to track progress.
- Everyone on the team communicates regularly, so issues are spotted and solved faster.

## So what methodology will we use?

## üìñ Summary
Agile is about working together, delivering value quickly, and improving as you go. Sprints help break down big projects into smaller, achievable goals. If you're new to Agile, focus on communication, flexibility, and delivering something useful at the end of each sprint.

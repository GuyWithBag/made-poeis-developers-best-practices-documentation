Creating Pull Requests (PRs) on GitHub

When creating a PR on GitHub, it's crucial to follow best practices to ensure clarity and ease of review.

The description should provide detailed information about what the PR does, why it is needed, and any other relevant context. It should also reference the JIRA story.

```

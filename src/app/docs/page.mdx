## ‚ùì Why create a documentation?
This will be used to document the internal workings of Made Poeis with the goal of achieving efficiency and clarity in our processes. 

## üë§ Who is this for?
For now, it is for the devlopers that need project standards and guidelines. 

## üíª What is the technology used to create this documentation?
- This documentation is built using [MDX//Markdown](https://mdxjs.com/), which allows us to write JSX in Markdown files. This enables us to create rich, interactive content while maintaining the simplicity of Markdown.
    - Why Markdown?
        - Primarily because it is easy to write in without your hand ever having to go back and forth your mouse.
        - Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows us to write formatted text using plain text syntax. 
- Graphs can be created using [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/), which allows us to create diagrams and flowcharts using a simple syntax.
- (For Developers) This documentation is created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and [Nextra](https://nextra.site/), a Next.js-based documentation site generator that provides a simple way to create and manage documentation sites.
    - This also uses App Router

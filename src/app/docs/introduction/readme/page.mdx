Instructions on how to run this and make changes to the project

## üõ†Ô∏è What you need to install

1. **Node.js**
   - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version for best stability.
2. **Git**
   - Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
   - Use the default options during installation.
3. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
   - Download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - During installation, check the box that says **"Add 'Open with Code' action to Windows Explorer file context menu"**. This makes it easy to open folders in VS Code.

## üíª Getting the project on your computer

1. **Open VS Code**
2. Open the built-in terminal in VS Code:
   - Click on `Terminal` in the top menu, then `New Terminal`.
3. In the terminal, type the following commands one by one:
   - `git clone <project-url>` (replace `<project-url>` with the link to this project)
   - `cd <project-folder>` (replace `<project-folder>` with the name of the folder that was created)
   - `git pull` (to make sure you have the latest version)
   - `npm install` (this installs everything the project needs)
   - `npm run dev` (this starts the project)
4. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## ‚úèÔ∏è Making changes

1. **Edit using VS Code**
   - Open the project folder in VS Code (right-click the folder and select `Open with Code` if you set this up during install).
   - Make your changes to the files as needed.
2. **Using the built-in Git GUI in VS Code**
   - Click the Source Control icon (it looks like a branch) on the left sidebar.
   - You will see a list of files you changed.
   - Type a short message describing your changes in the message box at the top.
   - Click the checkmark icon to commit your changes.
   - To send your changes to the online project, click the three dots (`...`) at the top of the Source Control panel and select `Push`.
3. **Working with branches**
   - Branches let you work on new features or fixes without affecting the main project.
   - To create a new branch, click the branch name at the bottom left of VS Code, then select `Create new branch`.
   - Switch between branches the same way.
   - Always make a new branch for your changes if you are not sure.
4. **Making a Pull Request**
   - After pushing your branch, go to the project page on GitHub.
   - You will see a button to create a Pull Request. Click it and follow the instructions.
   - This lets others review your changes before they are added to the main project.

## üìù Create and Editing Content in Detail

### üóíÔ∏è What is Markdown/MD/MDX?
- **Markdown** (files ending in `.md`) is a simple way to write formatted text using plain text. You can make headings, lists, links, images, and more without needing to know HTML.
- **MDX** (files ending in `.mdx`) is like Markdown, but it also lets you use React components and more advanced features. In this project, most documentation pages use MDX.
- You can learn more about Markdown here: [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

### üÜï How to Create a New Page
1. In VS Code, open the folder where you want to add your new page. For example, to add a new documentation page, open `src/app/docs/`.
2. Right-click the folder and select **New File**.
3. Name your file something like `your-topic/page.mdx` (for example, `my-guide/page.mdx`).
4. Start your file with a heading, like this:
   ```mdx
   # My Guide Title
   ```
5. Write your content using Markdown formatting. You can add headings, lists, images, and even React components if needed.
6. Save the file. Your new page will be available in the documentation site after you restart the development server (if it doesn't appear right away).

**Tip:**
- Use headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) to organize your content.
- Use lists (`- item`) for steps or bullet points.
- You can preview Markdown in VS Code by right-clicking the file and selecting **Open Preview**.

### üìä Using Mermaid Diagrams in MDX or HTML

You can add diagrams and flowcharts to your documentation using [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/). Mermaid lets you write simple text to create diagrams like flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and more.

#### üñºÔ∏è How to use Mermaid in MDX
1. In your `.mdx` file, you can use a special code block with `mermaid` as the language:
   ```mermaid
   graph TD;
     A-->B;
     A-->C;
     B-->D;
     C-->D;
   ```
   This will show a simple flowchart.
2. If your project supports Mermaid out of the box, the diagram will appear automatically. If not, ask a developer to help enable Mermaid support in the documentation site.

#### üåê How to use Mermaid in HTML
- If you need to use Mermaid in a regular HTML file, you can include the Mermaid library and add your diagram in a `<pre class="mermaid">` block. Example:
- For most users, using the MDX code block method is easiest.

**Tip:**
- You can find more examples and diagram types in the [Mermaid documentation](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/).

If you want to add a diagram and it doesn't show up, ask a developer for help to make sure Mermaid is enabled in the project.

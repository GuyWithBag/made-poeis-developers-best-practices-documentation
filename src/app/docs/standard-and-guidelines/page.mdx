# Project Standards and Guidelines 
## Why We Must Maintain These Standards
**THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT**
- Maintaining clear standards ensures our codebase is clean, consistent, and easy to understand for everyone on the team. 
    - Our Project needs to be understandable after future reading
- It helps new developers onboard quickly, reduces bugs, and makes collaboration smoother. 
- Following standards also makes it easier to scale the project and maintain quality as the team grows.

# ü§ù App/Website Team

#### Product Owner
- **Role**: Defines the project vision and prioritizes features.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Gathers feedback from the CEO and clients.
  - Manages the product backlog and approves sprint deliverables.
  - Communicates requirements to the team.
  - **Example**: Prioritizes a website checkout page for a sprint.
- **Tools**: Jira, Slack. 


## Agile Principles
- The team operates using **Agile methodologies**, delivering features in **1‚Äì4 week sprints** with regular feedback from the CEO and stakeholders.
- A **flat team structure** promotes collaboration and open communication.
- As the team grows, roles will become more specialized to maintain clarity and efficiency.

## Agile Ceremonies
All developer teams follow these Agile ceremonies to ensure alignment and continuous improvement:
- **Daily Stand-Up (15 min)**: Team members share progress, plans, and blockers (e.g., "Coded homepage, waiting for API").
- **Sprint Planning (2 hr)**: Select tasks from the backlog and set sprint goals (e.g., "Build gallery page").
- **Sprint Review (1 hr)**: Demo completed work to the Product Owner and CEO (e.g., responsive menu).
- **Retrospective (1 hr)**: Reflect on the sprint and identify improvements (e.g., "Streamline design handoff").
- **Backlog Refinement (1 hr)**: Prioritize and clarify upcoming tasks with the Product Owner.

## Workflow
1. **Product Owner** defines priorities (e.g., user authentication feature).
2. **UI/UX Designer** provides wireframes (if applicable).
3. **Developers** code features, commit to GitHub, and integrate APIs or services.
4. **QA Tester** verifies functionality, performance, and security.
5. **Product Owner and Head of Development** demo results to the CEO; feedback shapes the next sprint (e.g., "Add search functionality").

## Example Sprint
- **Goal**: Build a website's homepage and its backend API.
- **Front-End Team**: Codes a mobile-responsive homepage using React, based on UI/UX wireframes.
- **Back-End Team*: Builds an API for homepage content using Node.js and MongoDB.
- **Full-Stack Team**: Develops a small feature (e.g., contact form) end-to-end.
- **DevOps Team**: Ensures AWS hosting is stable and deploys updates.
- **Outcome**: QA tests the homepage and API, the Product Owner demos to the CEO, who requests a dark mode and search endpoint for the next sprint.

## Notes
- **Team Size**: Start with 2‚Äì3 developers per team; Full-Stack and DevOps can begin with one person. Scale with dedicated Scrum Masters as needed.
- **Collaboration**: Teams share APIs (Back-End to Front-End/Full-Stack), designs (UI/UX to Front-End), and infrastructure (DevOps). Stand-ups and reviews ensure alignment.
- **CEO Updates**: The Head of Development and Product Owner present sprint results in simple terms, ensuring alignment with creative goals.
- **Hiring**: Use LinkedIn to recruit developers and GitHub to showcase code, emphasizing the startup's creative focus.
- **Tools**: Centralized tools (Jira, Slack, GitHub, AWS) streamline communication and development.

# Scrum

## What is Scrum?
Scrum is a subset of Agile. It is a lightweight process framework for agile development, and the most widely-used one.
    A “process framework” is a particular set of practices that must be followed in order for a process to be consistent with the framework. (For example, the Scrum process framework requires the use of development cycles called Sprints, the XP framework requires pair programming, and so forth.)
    “Lightweight” means that the overhead of the process is kept as small as possible, to maximize the amount of productive time available for getting useful work done.

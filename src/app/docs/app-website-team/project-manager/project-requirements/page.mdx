# ⏱️ Project Requirements and Duration Estimation
- Requirements to keep in mind when working with the project management module. 
- This is a very important step as it will allow us to get a clear estimation of the project scope and timeline, and ensure that all team members are on the same page.
### Why calculate durations? 
- Project durations can help us estimate the time required to finish the project. 
- This will a foundation for our understanding in how much the project should be worth and how long it would take. 
- Duration could also help us estimate employee salary, whether per hour or other methods. 
- This will also help us plan for our next project and what our next action or motive should be, by worrying less about the what ifs and how long the project will take. 

--- 


**Notes:** #AIGenerated
- "d" = days of work (assume 1 day = 8 hours of focused work).
- Ranges are based on the lower and upper bounds of typical durations for each task.
- Some tasks can be done in parallel, so total project duration may be less than the sum of all tasks.
- UI/UX design is assumed to be done before or in parallel with development.

## Complexity Level Tags
To help estimate and communicate the effort required for different requirements or components that are not listed here, you can use standardized complexity tags. Each tag represents a typical range of work days needed to complete a task, making it easier to categorize and plan project work.

- **Simple** (`Simple`): 0.25 – 0.5 days
  - Straightforward tasks with minimal logic or UI, such as basic buttons, static text, or simple style changes.
- **Moderate** (`Moderate`): 1 – 3 days
  - Tasks with some logic, integration, or moderate UI/UX, such as forms with validation, list views, or basic API integration.
- **Complex** (`Complex`): 3 – 5 days
  - Tasks involving advanced logic, multiple integrations, or sophisticated UI/UX, such as dashboards, custom interactive components, or multi-step workflows.

> Assigning these tags to requirements helps teams quickly assess scope, prioritize work, and communicate expectations with stakeholders.

## First of All 
We need to see everybody's schedule. There is a website where users/employees can input their availability through a calendar (weekly). 
- This is necessary to do every project, if everybody is working in a hybrid or flexible schedule.

# 📝 Project Requirements Template 

[Refer to this page for the requirements, this page will be used a lot](/docs/project-management/project-requirements)

### First Of All 
We need these included in our docs.

- I think we will also need our own emails so that we can invite everyone easily through some type of grouping thingy. (i dont really know if we would need our own company emails??)

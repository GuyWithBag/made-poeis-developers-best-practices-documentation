# Project Standards and Guidelines 
## Why We Must Maintain These Standards
**THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT**
- Maintaining clear standards ensures our codebase is clean, consistent, and easy to understand for everyone on the team. 
    - Our project should be easily understandable not only by current team members but also by future developers who may join or review the project. Well-documented and standardized code reduces the learning curve and prevents knowledge silos.
    - Consistent naming conventions, file structures, and coding styles help everyone quickly locate and comprehend different parts of the codebase.
    - Clear standards make it easier to review code, spot potential issues, and ensure that best practices are followed throughout the project.
- It helps new developers onboard quickly, reduces bugs, and makes collaboration smoother. 
    - New team members can become productive faster when there is a clear set of guidelines to follow, minimizing confusion and mistakes.
    - Standardized processes and documentation reduce the likelihood of introducing bugs due to misunderstandings or inconsistent approaches.
    - Collaboration is enhanced when everyone is on the same page regarding how code should be written, reviewed, and maintained.
- Following standards also makes it easier to scale the project and maintain quality as the team grows.
    - As the project expands, having established standards ensures that quality is maintained even as more contributors join.
    - It allows for easier integration of new features, refactoring, and maintenance, as the codebase remains organized and predictable.
    - Adhering to standards supports long-term sustainability, making it possible to adapt to new requirements and technologies without sacrificing code quality.

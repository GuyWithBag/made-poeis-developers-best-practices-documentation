# DSM | Daily Standup Meetings

## What is DSM (Daily Standup Meeting)?

A **Daily Standup Meeting (DSM)**, also known as the Daily Scrum, is a short, time-boxed meeting (usually 15 minutes) held every working day for the Scrum team. Its primary purpose is to synchronize activities, create a plan for the next 24 hours, and quickly surface any impediments.

**In our case, our meetings while be no more shorter than 15 mins.**

### Role in Scrum

- **Synchronization:** The DSM helps the team stay aligned on goals and progress.
- **Transparency:** Everyone knows what others are working on, reducing duplication and confusion.
- **Inspection & Adaptation:** The team inspects progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapts the plan as needed.
- **Early Problem Detection:** Blockers and issues are identified early, so they can be addressed quickly.

### What Happens in a DSM?

**Each team member answers three key questions:**
1. **What did I do yesterday that helped the team meet the Sprint Goal?**
2. **What will I do today to help the team meet the Sprint Goal?**
3. **Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the team from meeting the Sprint Goal?**

**What the Scrum Master does:**
- Facilitates the meeting, ensuring it stays on track and within the timebox.
- Helps remove blockers raised by the team.
- Encourages participation and focus.

**What team members do:**
- Share concise updates relevant to the Sprint Goal.
- Raise blockers or impediments.
- Listen actively to others' updates.
- Avoid problem-solving during the meeting (take detailed discussions offline).

### Purpose and Importance of Keeping it Short

- **Efficiency:** The DSM is not for deep discussions; it's for quick updates and coordination.
- **Focus:** Keeps the team focused on progress and immediate needs.
- **Momentum:** A short, regular meeting helps maintain team momentum without disrupting work.

### Do's and Don'ts

**Do:**
- Be on time.
- Keep updates brief and relevant.
- Raise blockers clearly.
- Listen to others.

**Don't:**
- Dive into problem-solving or technical discussions (take these offline).
- Use the meeting for status reporting to the Scrum Master (it's for the team).
- Go off-topic.

### Where to Discuss Blockers

- **Blockers should be raised during the DSM.**
- **Detailed discussion and resolution of blockers should happen after the DSM,** either with the Scrum Master or relevant team members, so the meeting stays short and focused.

# Meetings

## Meeting Ethics

- **Use the "hands up" function** when you want to ask a question in non-discussion meetings. This helps maintain order and ensures everyone gets a chance to speak without interruptions.
- **Meeting organizers should record large, essential meetings** for those who cannot attend. This is especially important for meetings that are critical and involve many participants. Always inform attendees if the meeting is being recorded.
- **Be punctual**: Join meetings on time and be prepared with any necessary materials or updates.
- **Mute your microphone when not speaking** to minimize background noise and distractions.
- **Respect the agenda**: Stick to the topics outlined and avoid derailing the meeting with unrelated discussions.
- **Encourage inclusivity**: Give everyone an opportunity to contribute, especially quieter team members.
- **Follow up with notes or action items** after the meeting to ensure clarity and accountability.
